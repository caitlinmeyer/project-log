I spent a whole Sunday reorganizing and cleaning the crafting room. While having a functioning space again is a reward in itself, I also found a pillow case that I had pieced the front for, but never finished, behind the futon! I don't really need any more pillows, so I added about 6" of linen to the top of the square and made a fun quilted wall hanging. The design comes from my Death Valley linens project this spring, and I think, now, that the wall hanging format could be really good to give those designs another spin. I just need to have more forethought about hanging it up afterwards, so I could have incorporated a dowel slot or a rod pocket. Still pretty pleased with this quick make while I'm working on two large projects - All Well Workshop Studio Pants and my overdyed fabric quilt.
