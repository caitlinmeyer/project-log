It's done. It's finally done. My friends and family now know this project as "the hell quilt" because it just haunted me for months. I knew if I started working on garment sewing or playing with my new serger I would never finish this thing. Now I can play!

I have a big spreadsheet of projects I'd like to eventually try and vat dye, hand quilting, quilt-as-you-go, and throw blanket were all on there. In late September I identified a bunch of cotton I had that I didn't love and I decided to embark on this killing-a-ton-of-birds-with-one-hell-project-stone adventure. Initially I wanted to try improv quilting which is why I didn't pick a pattern prior to dyeing, but it just wasn't the right time to learn how to do that and I hit some walls with curves pretty quickly.

Process overview: 
*This process made no sense! I had no plan! If I were to do it all again, I would seriously edit this order of operations.*

1. **Overdye fabric.** I identified about four yards of Kona cotton leftover from other things and online orders where my screen color didn't match the fabric. I've since ordered the swatch booklet to avoid future mishaps like these!
   * Pre-wash and dry fabric
   * Prep dye baths with Dharma Procion dye and soda ash
   * I let the fabric chill crunched up overnight
   * Rinse, wash again, dry
   * Iron!
2. **Try, and fail, improv quilting.** Gave up on this nearly immediately. The colors in this quilt are loosely from our honeymoon in Colorado. I initially wanted to improv piece abstract landscapes based on photos I took, but shelved this idea for a future project.
3. **Pick a pattern.** Jinny Beyer's "Patchwork Patterns" is a crucial reference text for me. I found the block 'Mrs. Cleveland's Choice' and decided to blow up what's intended to be one block into a full quilt.

4. **Map out colors and start cutting 6.75" squares.**

5. **Sew half square triangles as directed by the map.**
6. **Piece quilt with sewing machine in nine 2' squares.**

7. **Acquire backing fabric, wash and press, cut into ~26" squares.**
8. **Cut backing and baste the nine ~2' tiles.** This was my first project with basting spray and omg I love it so much :').
9. **Quilt each tile by hand, leaving approximately an inch on all sides of the top to allow for later machine piecing.** I used embroidery floss. I figured if I was going to all of this work, I wanted the handmade-ness of it to be visible. I really like big stitch quilting and learned a few new stitches, like the x's in the orange, for this project.

10. **Machine piece the fronts of three tiles together.** Thank God for my new sewing cabinet and machine. The extendable leaves made this slightly more manageable than it would have been with my old Singer and desk set up.
11. **Felt together batting in each row of three and close the backs by hand.** Using a felting needle, I kind of merged together the three batting tiles into a continuous piece. Then I closed the two backing gaps by hand with a visible diagonal stitch with embroidery floss.
12. **Machine piece two rows of three tiles together.** This was brutal. Lots of pins and clips and managing unwieldy, heavy quilt parts.

13. **Felt batting, close backs.** 
14. **Repeat 12 and 13 with the third row of tiles.** Again the expandable table was a huge help here, but this was still immensely difficult. 
15. **Complete hand-quilting across the previously independent tiles.** This was particularly necessary for the orange and brown, to complete the diamond.
16. **Cut and dye strips for binding**.
17. **Square up quilt with rotary blade and ruler.** This wasn't as bad as I thought it might be given the quilt's 144 squares, nine tiles, and piecemeal quilting approach. Things were overall pretty well-aligned.
18. **Attach binding with the machine to the front of the quilt.** This was frankly terrible! So heavy and tough to maneuver! Grateful the new machine's default setting is to leave the needle down after you stop stitching.
19. **Fold over binding and clip to the back.** Used almost 100 binding clips for this process. Three of the four mitered corners look good!
20. **Attach binding to the back of the quilt by hand with contrasting embroidery floss.** Again, I wanted all of the hand work to be very visible to anybody who sees this quilt. I think a lot of people don't know how labor-intensive quilts are, and perhaps seeing the thousands of stitches will be helpful in dispelling those misconceptions!

I learned so much throughout the course of this project. I was really excited about the idea of quilting as you go to make large projects more doable at home. However, piecing all of the quilted tiles together was still very difficult. I look forward to the public library reopening so I can use their longarm quilting machine and try out a different process.

We're daydreaming about owning a cabin in Vermont or New Hampshire and having this quilt there. Something to work towards! For now, I am going to work on much, much, much smaller projects.
