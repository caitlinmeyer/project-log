Another weird project, more weird artifacts. I sewed Geoffrey a bunch of masks for work in the straightforward rectangle + pleats + elastic method and they worked great for him! However that shape was making my glasses fog up incessantly. It wasn't a huge problem since I rarely leave the house these days, but I decided to give [a different design](https://blog.treasurie.com/diy-mask/) a try. Worked great! Shout out to Alicia for the .25" bias tape maker... finicky, but the final look reminds me of those American Apparel sweatshirt jackets everybody had in high school.
