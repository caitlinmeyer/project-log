A coworker told me about [this pattern for an apron](https://www.purlsoho.com/create/2015/11/20/cross-back-apron/) and I couldn't not make it. I dyed some canvas duck fabric and then assembled it for a fun color-block feel. It's funny because (I'm writing this months later) this was my last project in these super bright colors - I've been gravitating towards a richer, more earth toned range lately. I'll probably remake this in a lighter fabric in darker colors at some point. The pattern was easy to follow, for the most part, I just picked really heavy fabric which made the four (!!!!) layers of fabric in the straps a very frustrating experience... many broken needles... Still! Happy with how it turned out and will make one again someday.
