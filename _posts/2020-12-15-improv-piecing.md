Oh man, I've been interested in trying out improvisational piecing as a way to reduce waste and use up scraps. It. Is. So. Fun. I am just loving all of these Essex colors together and finally used sparkly fabric in a way I feel isn't cheap-looking. I had intended to piece this together and then cut it up again to make quilted zipper pouches but now I think it's too pretty...
