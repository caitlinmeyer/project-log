I'd made one of these last year but have gotten way better at sewing - so the final project is more structurally sound and aesthetically pleasing! The lining fabric is fabric I somewhat unsuccessfully ice-dyed with Rit and the exterior is corduroy I got when a local Joann store went out of business.
