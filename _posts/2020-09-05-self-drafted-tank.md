I had some leftover Essex linen after the Death Valley pillows project and decided I wanted to try garment sewing. I traced a knit tank I really like (later realizing knit and wovens are different! Very different!) and it worked out way better than I could have anticipated considering how little I know and how little time it took. I improvised some darts, too, for better fit. After, I ice dyed it with Dharma Trading's indigo procion dye. Too fun!
