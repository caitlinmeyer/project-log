Just like the bachelor party shirt, another artifact from an event that didn't happen. Due to the pandemic we canceled our wedding just six short weeks after sending out these beautiful handmade invitations. So it goes. I was pretty proud of the watercolor wash on the main invite, which I then just ran through our home printer. This project was immensely time consuming, painting 60+ invites and printing and cutting everything myself.
