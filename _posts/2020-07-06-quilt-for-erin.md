My sister gets cold a lot so I decided to make her a fun lap quilt she could have on during Zoom meetings. I modified [Purl Soho's tiny tile quilt](https://www.purlsoho.com/create/2015/06/08/tiny-tile-quilt/) and made the tiles marginally bigger to fit with the size fabric strips I had. I used a whole piece of ice dyed fabric from the spring on the back and love how vibrant it all looks together. Quilting in July without central air conditioning, though... cannot recommend.
