I had leftover linen from the Death Valley projects and decided to make a mask and two bandanas for myself with it and the new set of ice dye colors I got from Dharma Trading. This new color range feels very autumnal and beautiful. I can't wait to make more things with it. I tried faux-serging the edges of the bandana with a tight zig zag stitch. I like the rawness. I also made Geoffrey another mask, though he still prefers the quilting cotton (and it's better since he works inside).
