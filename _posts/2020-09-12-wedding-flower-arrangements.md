After canceling our big wedding, we decided to keep the new one really small. We found a florist who sold bulk flowers and tried out arranging flowers! Using the foam for the arch piece was more difficult than anticipated but I am happy with how it came out. Really, anything with sunflowers is perfect. My mom, sister, and I made my bouquet and then friends each took a stab at the table pieces. It's one of my favorite wedding weekend memories.
