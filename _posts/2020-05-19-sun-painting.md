I read about sun dyeing on a few blogs and decided to ask for a set of materials for my birthday. I ended up going with [this Dharma Trading tutorial and recommendations](https://www.dharmatrading.com/techniques/sun-painting-with-setacolor.html), which is technically sun painting and not sun dyeing, but still a ton of fun! I learned about how to mix the paints to a proper dilution and how to start arranging botanicals. Looking forward to exploring this more as the heat continues.
