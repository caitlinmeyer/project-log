It's been a rough few weeks on the creative practice front. I've started reading The Artist's Way and it's been great working through all of the exercises and trying to start a morning pages practice, but it's also been bringing up a lot of feelings to work through. I'm optimistic I'll work through it. A few weeks back after I finished the hell quilt, I tried batik for the first time. I couldn't get the wax to melt to a high enough temperature so I had to give up after spending most of a day tinkering with a crockpot. Pretty dishearteneing! 

So anyway, I decided a few days ago I need to start working through my "sidelined works in progress" bucket as a way to make room for new ideas. I started these wall hangings last summer after I made my own as a test to try timing each stage of production sewing to get an idea of what I'd have to price these at for it to be worthwhile. What does 8 months of time unfinished in the closet cost? Haha. Jokes aside, I'm pleased with how they came out even if I didn't arrive at that number I initially took on this project to find. 

I think I'm going to just keep sewing stuff in small batches so that whenever markets come back and I can see what pepole gravitate towards. 

The piecing is tricky on the mountains but I have dramatically improved my sewing skills since I pieced these last summer. They're about 16" wide and about 24" tall. I imagine them being hung with a dowel rod through the pocket and fun string going up to a single nail in a triangle.
