I had been doodling this design in a notebook for weeks when I decided to just go for it. I mocked it up in Illustrator to get the measurements, cut thick paper to the right sizes, sewed the strips together, then cut and pieced. The hand stitching was tedious but rewarding, I love how it came together.
