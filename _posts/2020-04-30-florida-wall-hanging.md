I was talking to Patrick, who was riding out the rona in Florida. I saw these colors come together in my fabric bin and wanted to play with them more. The mockup and measurements were done in Illustrator. This was the project I unfortunately learned how important walking foots are... lots of pulling on the top layer of fabric and it was too difficult to yank it all out. Live and learn!
