I designed this quilt top to go with a pillow case I made and hand-quilted last fall. I realized after piecing it that I did not prewash the fabric and have been nervous about shrinkage and have stalled on further progress. I've also started buying more expensive fabric since and balk at investing more time in this project since it's using Joann's super-cheap fabric. Lessons learned, lessons learned.
