My brother just moved into a new apartment! I offered to make him a few pillows for a new couch, which he gladly accepted. The colors are a little more muted than the ones I made for our home in the spring, but are still Essex linen and still look fabulous (in my opinion!). I think I like this envelope back better than messing with the zipper closure I did in the spring, and I'm stoked about the progress I see in my technical skills here navigating these Y-seams.
