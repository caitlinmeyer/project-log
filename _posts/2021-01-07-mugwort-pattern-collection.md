I've been toying with making surface pattern designs from the sun dyed fabrics I created this summer for about a month and I am thrilled with how this turned out. I took a photo of the mugwort fabric with Office Lens on my phone so I could get it at the proper, level angle and crop it. From there, I imported the image into Illustrator and traced the image. It took a bunch of tries with numbers of colors to get something usable out of the traced result and five colors ended up being the sweet spot between detail and exractability of the leaf shapes. From there, I cleaned up the vectors a little bit and started to play! The color range is based on dyes that I currently have and want to keep working in for the time being to create some sort of coherence across the various media I am working in.

This one came about by accident. I was working on the pattern below and I accidentally changed fill color on a few leaves instead of line color. I loved the outcome and it is certainly the centerpiece of this collection.

Love the large scale of this one.

While these look like abstract squiggles, they are acutally hyper-enlarged mugwort leaves layered on top of each other.

The collection needed something orderly after the three chaotic entries so far, and this wavy stripe also lets people see the detail of the leaves.

Every collection that could be used for quilting needs a tiny print to balance the huge ones. This confetti mugwort came second in the design process and I just love it.

Thrilled with these, like I said above. I'm trying to decide if I should build more of a pattern portfolio or just let the creativity ride and go where it takes me (the latter always wins).
