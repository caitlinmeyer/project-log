I've toyed around with trying a quilted zipper pouch for a few months now. I'm trying to work through some scrap fabric before my latest excessive fabric order arrives, so this seemed like a good time to give it a whirl. I was sort of following Purl Soho's quilted pouch instructions from 2015. However, I should get better at following instructions, because I did the zipper the way I learned on the pear pouches which meant I wasn't able to topstitch the zipper down. Now it catches in the fabric... and my machine was inexplicably skipping stitches (despite a new needle, new bobbin, rethreading everything, and checking tension)... but! It's done and I can't say I'd like to do more but at least know what to do (and what not to do) next time.
