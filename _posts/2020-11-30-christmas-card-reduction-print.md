Blockprinting has always been frustrating for me because of the gap between what I want to accomplish and my actual skill level. Looking back, I think I also wanted something out of blockprinting that wasn't a good fit for that medium. I wanted really clean design that is better suited for screenprinting, and just didn't have the resources or space at that time to set up a screenprinting studio. Something I've been forced to think about with sewing lately is materiality. Texture. The inherent differences between types of fabric. Taking this awareness or acceptance or mindset or whatever you might call it back to blockprinting ended up being really, really fun.

I decided to try out reduction printing for the first time. Cutting away at the block. Set editions. No going back. I also embraced the shapes of the gouge marks and tried to use it to create motion and light. You know this is a blockprint by looking at it -- something my previous efforts in this space weren't going for and didn't really accomplish.

The registration between layers isn't perfect and I would probably distinguish more between some of the layers in the colors, but I am really excited about how this turned out and about having blockprinting back in my life.
