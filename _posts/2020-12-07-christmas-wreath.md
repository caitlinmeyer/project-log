The tree farm we went to had plain wreaths for $10.. so of course I had to try my hand at decorating one! A strand of small, battery-powered lights, leftover ball ornaments, and some fun seasonal clip-on decorations from a Trader Joe's tree Geoffrey bought years ago resulted in this sweet, glowing piece of holiday cheer.
