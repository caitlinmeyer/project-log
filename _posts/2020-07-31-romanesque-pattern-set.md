I spent a good bit of July in a funk. We were debating canceling the wedding, the pandemic raged on, and it was hot as hell. I decided to step back and look at a bunch of art that's inspired me through the years and stop looking at Instagram. It was such a treat and generative exercise! This pattern set is based on elements found in Romanesque art housed in Barcelona at MNAC. I was awestruck by the collection when I saw it eight years ago and was happy to rediscover and reimagine it.
