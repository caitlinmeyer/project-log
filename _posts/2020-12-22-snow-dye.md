I was curious to see if I could do ice dye, but with snow. So many questions -- how long would it take to melt? Would the vibrancy be the same? Would it distribute through folded layers? It was about 40 degrees out and I put about an inch of a half of snow on top of folded up 22" squares in a light hemp/cotton knit, Kona PFD, and Essex PFD. Dye component colors expressing themselves are always a fun part of ice dye and that was true again here. Colors I put into the mix disappeared, others made surprise appearances. I used Dharma procion dyes in black cherry, indigo, and pagota red in one tub and wedgewood blue, grecian sea, and moss (I think? having a hard time remembering) in the other. I think I should have used a little less powder and given them more time. The linen turned out the best and the knits ended up with some muddiness that I wonder if is due to being a knit or being so thin or! the addition of hemp to the blend. Who knows. Fun experiment! Now I just need to finish the edges with the serger.

I ended up washing everything out after the snow melted to expose the fabric. It took about 30 hours.

This one almost looks like oxidizing metals, which is an unanticipated but fun effect.

The thick folds here ended up with the most distinct lines and shapes. Should have allowed more time for dye penetration, I think.

Rolled the knit from the edge to get this one, I love it.

Essex linen, old reliable. Best in the batch by far.
