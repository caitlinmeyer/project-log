The fabric took forevvvvvver to come in. I took each segment of the original design in Illustrator and scaled them up to the size pillow I wanted to make. From there, I added an outline that would print out to be the .25" seam allowance. In later pillows, I figured out how to make it a thin second line instead of burning through all the printer ink. Thin corners are tough to bring together and Essex linen is a bit finicky, or at least more finicky than Kona, which is all I've sewn with so far. Still pretty pleased with stumbling through this process and learning a ton about making my own sewing patterns!
