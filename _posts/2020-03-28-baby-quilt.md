Early into the coronavirus pandemic and quarantine, I made my cousin a baby quilt. I can't imagine the stress of expecting during such a terrible time, and my goal was to hopefully bring a smile to their face. This was my first complete quilt, so I learned how to do binding as well as the difficulties of quilting on a small, basic sewing machine. I got the design from a 70s quilting book I got for Christmas. I like the aesthetic of taking designs meant for one small quilt block and blowing them up to be the whole design.
